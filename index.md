### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one my favorites because it was our first lab in class. Basically gave us the blueprint on how the lab was going to be. Looking back on it now it was a while ago, but it was a great first impression.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was also one my favorites becuase it had some math in it. Math being my favorite subject I really enjoyed the caluclatiing Area of the Rectangle part of it. It was also quite the challenge at this time.

* Lab 6 
    Lab 6 was my third favorite one because of the blackjack part. Reminded me of playing it with my family. Also had a great partner to work with in this lab, made it really easy to work and also had a good time.
